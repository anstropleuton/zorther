            <h3>Prologue: The Planet</h3>
            <p>On the distant planet of Zorther, life lived with peace and harmony. It has fresh air, lush trees, clean rivers and oceans. There was little to no pollution. It's inhabitance, the Zorthians, lived in a remarkable society with highly advanced technology. Sky-touching skyscraper, metallic yet soft transportation highways, beautiful gardens and more.</p>
            <p>Their chemistry advancements are also noteworthy. They have discovered many new elements including Luminite (L), Vazron (Qa) and Silquor (Sq). With these, they have invented a special metal named Xerithium (L₃Qa₂TiNi). This metal absorbs dust and other particles within itself. It can contain these particles within for a long period of time, and will eject all the particles it contains when it is contacted with a special inert gas Valxuor (L₄Sq₂Ar₃H₂). These and other elements are also used in various other technologies.
            </p>
            <p>One of the most notable, highly advanced technology was the layered infrastructure. The planet Zorther is composed of multiple spheres. Think of it as hollow spheres present in larger hollow spheres. This system created multiple layers for Zorthians to live in. From one surface layer to 10 underground layers. This technology allowed Zorthians to manage population density across various layers. Despite this, each layers were treated equally. Surface level was not more luxurious than the deepest underground level. Anybody could travel on any other layer, using various public transportation infrastructure.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent was the massive large elevator platforms. These circular platforms of large radius could go from and to all the layers within minutes. Some who owned apartments on two or more layers constructed their own elevators within their base. There were even tunnels for kids to go around with joy.</p>
            <p>However, there existed two last layers of the Zorther. Located in deepest depths, separated by a large, vast solid planetary crust, just above the mantle, was the Depths layers. These forbidden layers had the strongest prisons, which were used to keep the most dangerous criminals. This prison was used only as life imprisonment sentences. Along with the prisons, it also had secure sealed chambers which housed storage for old, deadly or forgotten inventions. There was only one point of entrance and exit to this layer. This depth provided natural protection to the surface layers, as well as underground layers, which did not go nearly as deep.</p>
            <p>It was said that no force can ever escape the Depths into the outer layers. Being this deep, however, also introduced hot temperatures in them. Around 40° C, not enough to be unbearable, but enough to be uncomfortable. The thick air within also made situation more uncomfortable. This was a mysterious place even for Zorthians, only the highest ranking authorities were even allowed to check on this place.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1: The Scientist’s Folly</h3>
            <p>In the fifth underground layer of Zorther lived Dr. Vekroth Ilzhar, a brilliant yet notorious scientist with a penchant for reckless innovation. Vekroth was a visionary driven by an insatiable desire to push boundaries, often at the expense of his and others safety. His latest creation, the Zephyride, was intended to revolutionize Zorthian lifestyle. This sleek, modern looking, mind-controlled mobility device offered unparalleled ease and comfort, allowing its users to traverse any terrain and perform complex tasks effortlessly.</p>
            <p>After months and months of trials and vigours testing, Vekroth proudly unveiled the Zephyride on the surface level, inviting volunteers to test it. To his dismay, the demonstration ended in catastrophe. The device caused users to lose control of their bodies and minds, as though it were overtaking them instead. Worse still, some reported sensations of their minds "corroding" and their bodies succumbing to a hidden malice, as if "boiling". The test was immediately terminated at the instant users noticed the abnormalities. Thankfully, everyone came out unharmed. Outraged, including his previous harmful inventions and actions, Zorthian authorities have had enough. They confiscated the remaining devices and sentenced Vekroth to eternal imprisonment in the Depths. He was gone for good. His work was declared a danger to society, and the Zephyride was locked away alongside other perilous creations in the vault of the Depths.
            </p>
            <p>Rumors started spreading around. Stories were shared. Many believed that Vekroth will never show his face, while some speculated that he will somehow be able to return. "Will he ever show up?" "No force escapes the Depths," "It is impossible, right?"</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2: A Family on the Surface</h3>
            <p>Among Zorther’s surface-dwellers lived the Eryssian family, whose youngest member, fifteen-year-old Lirien Eryss, had participated in the ill-fated Zephyride trial. Unlike the others, Lirien had managed to partially control the device, though she too abandoned it before any harm could befall her. Months later, her curiosity reignited when his elder brothers, Toris and Valtor, stumbled upon an abandoned Zephyride hidden in a neglected storage facility, which was yet to be sent to the Depths. They took it out and sent it to Lirien.</p>
            <p>Intrigued, Lirien began to study the device in secret, discovering troubling modifications within its design. Hidden programming suggested the Zephyride was engineered not just for comfort, but for control—perhaps even enslavement. Alarmed yet determined to uncover the truth, Lirien delved deeper, unaware of how closely her fate was tied to the imprisoned scientist who had created it.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 3: Earth’s Forgotten Layers</h3>
            <p>Centuries ago, Zorthians had invented cosmic travel technology. This allowed them to visit planets with ease. They have invented starships to travel anywhere in the space, and vast-distance transporters named Hypergate that allowed them to travel between two fixed points in planets.</p>
            <p>Hypergate was much faster than starship, which was used to travel between planets, sometimes even less than a day, but it required setting up endpoints. With these in hand, Zorthians had visited Earth, sharing their advanced knowledge with its inhabitants. They built layered systems identical to those on Zorther, enabling humans and Zorthians to coexist in harmony. However, when the Zorthians left during the mysterious abandoning phase, they buried these systems deep beneath the ground, fearing the potential misuse of their inventions. Only a few human elders, such as Mara Efrain, retained knowledge of this history.</p>
            <p>As a child, Mara had witnessed the Zorthians’ departure and the deliberate concealment of their technology. Her family agreed to keep this knowledge hidden, understanding the dangers buried alongside the layers. But Mara, now in her twilight years, feared that silence was no longer the answer. If the secrets of the layers were discovered by the wrong hands, humanity could face devastation.</p>
            <p>Mara saw a spark of potential in Kael Yorran, a curious fifteen-year-old rich neighbor with an insatiable sense of wonder. She first met him years earlier when he was a precocious child, fascinated by her stories and inventions. Knowing Kael’s curiosity could lead him to the truth, she waited for the right moment to act.</p>
            <p>When Kael lost a coin in his backyard, Mara gifted him a device that could detect buried objects, suggesting it might help him find the coin. She knew Kael would tinker with it, inevitably uncovering more than he bargained for. As expected, Kael quickly pushed the device’s settings to their maximum depth. Moments later, the detecter showed him a stunning object: an enormous, buried structure far beneath his home.</p>
            <p>Driven by curiosity, Kael brought equipments to facilitate cultivation. In the upcoming days, he secretly began digging with the machineries they could afford, unearthing fragments of the forgotten Zorthian layer system. With each new discovery, he found himself drawn deeper into the mystery of Earth’s hidden past.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 4: Escape and Convergence</h3>
            <p>In the fiery Depths of Zorther, Dr. Vekroth languished in his prison cell, consumed by rage and regret. One fateful day, a lapse in security and his brilliance allowed him to escape the prison cell. Alarms blared as guards rushed to contain him. Vekroth, knowing he can never escape these layers with only one exit from which guards were arriving, sprinted in the opposite direction, in hopes that he could find something. He slipped into the unguarded vaults of the Depths.</p>
            <p>To his astonishment, he found himself surrounded by relics of Zorthian ingenuity—abandoned inventions he had believed destroyed. Among them was a transportation device, the Hypergate, a prototype capable of crossing vast distances. Vekroth knew exactly what this was and how to use it, as these were invented by his very own ancestors. He recalled the history books he read which had rich details of Hypergate's usage. Driven by desperation and a flicker of hope, Vekroth desperately repaired the machine and activated it, setting endpoint coordinates for an ancient Zorthian colony: Earth.</p>
            <p>Boom. The device propelled him into the heart of Earth’s now deeply buried layer system, into the dormant machinery, and triggering subtle tremors on the surface. He was in the Depths layer, just as deeply buried as the ones in Zorther, but without anybody living in the layers. The guards on the Zorther left confused, searching him in every corners. Meanwhile, Kael’s digging brought him perilously close to the surface level of the hidden infrastructure. within was Vekroth, now ploting his next move.</p>

            <h3>Epilogue: A Collision of Worlds</h3>
            <p>Back on Zorther, Lirien’s investigations revealed that the Zephyride was no mere invention—it was a tool of control, possibly tied to a long-buried conspiracy. Determined to uncover its origins and prevent further harm, she set her sights on the Depths, preparing to defy the laws that barred her from venturing there.</p>
            <p>On Earth, Kael finally reached the surface of the hidden layers. Unknowing of the sheer scale, he tries to dig it out of the ground. He digs around to find the ends of it, but to no avail. For him, it almost seemed infinitely large, because... it is. Luckily, he have discovered the entrance of the underground layer. He took a deep breath and jumped in. He was now in. He was stunned, seeing the vast scale from inside. It seemed to him as if he left his world. He discovered cryptic inscriptions and artifacts that hinted at Zorther’s forgotten presence. Each step brought him closer to the truth, and closer to the escaped scientist who now lurked within Earth’s Depths layer.</p>
            <p>The fates of Lirien and Kael were set on a collision course, their shared curiosity drawing them into a mystery spanning two planets. Together, they would face the legacy of Zorthian technology, the schemes of Dr. Vekroth, and the buried truths that connected Earth and Zorther in ways they could scarcely imagine. Beneath the layers of their worlds lay the keys to their futures—and the dangers that could destroy them both.</p>
            <p>Their worlds were only beginning to converge, with secrets buried deeper than they could fathom and dangers lurking just beyond their reach. What lay beneath the layers was more than history—it was the future of two civilizations.</p>
