            <h3>Prologue: The Planet</h3>
            <p>On the distant planet of Zorther, life lived with peace and harmony. It has fresh air, lush trees, clean rivers and oceans. There was little to no pollution. It's inhabitance, the Zorthians, lived in a remarkable society with highly advanced technology. Sky-touching skyscraper, metallic yet soft transportation highways, beautiful gardens and more.</p>
            <p>Their chemistry advancements are also noteworthy. They have discovered many new elements including Luminite (L), Vazron (Qa) and Silquor (Sq). With these, they have invented a special metal named Xerithium (L₃Qa₂TiNi). This metal absorbs dust and other particles within itself. It can contain these particles within for a long period of time, and will eject all the particles it contains when it is contacted with a special inert gas Valxuor (L₄Sq₂Ar₃H₂). These and other elements are also used in various other technologies.</p>
            <p>One of the most notable, highly advanced technology was the layered infrastructure. The planet Zorther is composed of multiple spheres. Think of it as hollow spheres present in larger hollow spheres. This system created multiple layers for Zorthians to live in. From one surface layer to 10 underground layers. This technology allowed Zorthians to manage population density across various layers. Despite this, each layers were treated equally. Surface level was not more luxurious than the deepest underground level. Anybody could travel on any other layer, using various public transportation infrastructure.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent was the massive large elevator platforms. These circular platforms of large radius could go from and to all the layers within minutes. Some who owned apartments on two or more layers constructed their own elevators within their base. There were even tunnels for kids to go around with joy.</p>
            <p>However, there existed two last layers of the Zorther. Located in deepest depths, separated by a large, vast solid planetary crust, just above the mantle, was the Depths layers. These forbidden layers had the strongest prisons, which were used to keep the most dangerous criminals. This prison was used only as life imprisonment sentences. Along with the prisons, it also had secure sealed chambers which housed storage for old, deadly or forgotten inventions. There was only one point of entrance and exit to this layer. This depth provided natural protection to the surface layers, as well as underground layers, which did not go nearly as deep.</p>
            <p>It was said that no force can ever escape the Depths into the outer layers. Being this deep, however, also introduced hot temperatures in them. Around 40° C, not enough to be unbearable, but enough to be uncomfortable. The thick air within also made situation more uncomfortable. This was a mysterious place even for Zorthians, only the highest ranking authorities were even allowed to check on this place.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1: The Scientist’s Folly</h3>
            <p>In the fifth underground layer of Zorther lived Dr. Vekroth Ilzhar, a brilliant yet notorious scientist with a penchant for reckless innovation. Vekroth was a visionary driven by an insatiable desire to push boundaries, often at the expense of his and others' safety. His latest creation, the Zephyride, was intended to revolutionize Zorthian lifestyle. This sleek, modern-looking, mind-controlled mobility device offered unparalleled ease and comfort, allowing its users to traverse any terrain and perform complex tasks effortlessly.</p>
            <p>After months and months of trials and vigorous testing, Vekroth proudly unveiled the Zephyride on the surface level, inviting volunteers to test it. To his dismay, the demonstration ended in catastrophe. "I can't control it!" one of the testers screamed, panic evident in their voice. The device caused users to lose control of their bodies and minds, as though it were overtaking them instead. Worse still, some reported sensations of their minds "corroding" and their bodies succumbing to a hidden malice, as if "boiling." The test was immediately terminated the instant users noticed the abnormalities. Thankfully, everyone came out unharmed. Outraged of his actions, counting his previous harmful inventions and actions, Zorthian authorities had had enough. They confiscated the remaining devices and sentenced Vekroth to eternal imprisonment in the Depths. "He will never harm anyone again," one official declared. He was gone for good. His work was declared a danger to society, and the Zephyride was locked away alongside other perilous creations in the vault of the Depths.</p>
            <p>Rumors started spreading around. Stories were shared. Many believed that Vekroth would never show his face again, while some speculated that he would somehow be able to return. "Will he ever show up?" "No force escapes the Depths," "It’s impossible, right?"</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2: A Family on the Surface</h3>
            <p>Among Zorther’s surface-dwellers lived the Eryssian family, whose youngest member, fifteen-year-old Lirien Eryss, had participated in the ill-fated Zephyride trial. Unlike the others, Lirien had managed to partially control the device, though she too abandoned it before any harm could befall her. Months later, her curiosity reignited when her elder brothers, Toris and Valtor, stumbled upon an abandoned Zephyride hidden in a neglected storage facility, which was yet to be sent to the Depths. "I think we should take it to Lirien," Toris said, wiping dust off the device. They sent it to her.</p>
            <p>Intrigued, Lirien began to study the device in secret, discovering troubling modifications within its design. "This isn't just for comfort," she muttered under her breath as she examined the hidden programming. "It’s designed for control... maybe even enslavement." Alarmed yet determined to uncover the truth, Lirien delved deeper, unaware of how closely her fate was tied to the imprisoned scientist who had created it.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 3: Earth’s Forgotten Layers</h3>
            <p>Centuries ago, Zorthians had invented cosmic travel technology. This allowed them to visit planets with ease. They had invented starships to travel anywhere in space, and vast-distance transporters named Hypergate that allowed them to travel between two fixed points on planets.</p>
            <p>Hypergate was much faster than starship, which was used to travel between planets, sometimes even less than a day, but it required setting up endpoints. With these in hand, Zorthians had visited Earth, sharing their advanced knowledge with its inhabitants. They built layered systems identical to those on Zorther, enabling humans and Zorthians to coexist in harmony. However, when the Zorthians left during the mysterious abandoning phase, they buried these systems deep beneath the ground, fearing the potential misuse of their inventions. Only a few human elders, such as Mara Efrain, retained knowledge of this history.</p>
            <p>As a child, Mara had witnessed the Zorthians’ departure and the deliberate concealment of their technology. Her family agreed to keep this knowledge hidden, understanding the dangers buried alongside the layers. But now, in her twilight years, Mara feared that silence was no longer the answer. "If the wrong hands discover these secrets..." she whispered, "humanity could be in danger."</p>
            <p>Mara saw a spark of potential in Kael Yorran, a curious fifteen-year-old rich neighbor with an insatiable sense of wonder. She first met him years earlier when he was a precocious child, fascinated by her stories and inventions. "Kael, you’ve always asked the right questions," she told him one afternoon. "Perhaps it’s time you learn the truth."</p>
            <p>When Kael lost a coin in his backyard, Mara gifted him a device that could detect buried objects. "This might help you find your coin," she suggested, knowing he would tinker with it and inevitably uncover more than he bargained for. As expected, Kael quickly pushed the device’s settings to their maximum depth. Moments later, the detector showed him a stunning object: an enormous, buried structure far beneath his home.</p>
            <p>Driven by curiosity, Kael brought equipment to facilitate excavation. "Let’s see what else is down here," he said excitedly, ready to dig. In the upcoming days, he secretly began digging with the machinery they could afford, unearthing fragments of the forgotten Zorthian layer system. With each new discovery, he found himself drawn deeper into the mystery of Earth’s hidden past.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 4: Escape and Convergence</h3>
            <p>In the fiery Depths of Zorther, Dr. Vekroth languished in his prison cell, consumed by rage and regret. One fateful day, a lapse in security and his brilliance allowed him to escape the prison cell. "This is my chance!" he thought, his mind racing as alarms blared. Guards rushed to contain him, but Vekroth, knowing there was only one exit and it was already guarded, sprinted in the opposite direction, hoping he could find something to aid his escape. "There has to be another way out," he muttered, his heart pounding. He slipped into the unguarded vaults of the Depths.</p>
            <p>To his astonishment, he found himself surrounded by relics of Zorthian ingenuity—abandoned inventions he had believed destroyed. "I can use this," Vekroth whispered to himself as he inspected a familiar device—a Hypergate. This prototype, capable of crossing vast distances, had been invented by his very own ancestors. He recalled the history books he had read, which detailed Hypergate's usage. Driven by desperation and a flicker of hope, Vekroth began to repair the machine. "If I can just fix this," he said, his hands trembling as he worked, "I can escape to Earth." He activated the device, setting endpoint coordinates for an ancient Zorthian colony: Earth.</p>
            <p>Boom. The device propelled him into the heart of Earth’s now deeply buried layer system, triggering subtle tremors on the surface. He had landed deep within the Depths. Meanwhile, the guards on Zorther were left confused, searching every corner for him. "Where did he go?" one of them asked, frustration in their voice. But Vekroth’s escape had already set the stage for something far bigger.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Kael’s digging brought him perilously close to the surface level of the hidden infrastructure. Within the forgotten Zorthian layers, Vekroth was now plotting his next move.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Chapter 5: Beneath the Layers</h3>
            <p>Back on Zorther, Lirien’s investigations revealed that the Zephyride was no mere invention—it was a tool of control, possibly tied to a long-buried conspiracy. "I knew it," she muttered as she poured over the hidden programming she had uncovered. "This device was never meant to help. It’s designed to dominate." Determined to uncover its origins and prevent further harm, Lirien set her sights on the Depths, preparing to defy the laws that barred her from venturing there. "I have to know the truth," she told herself, packing a bag with supplies for the journey. "I’m going, no matter what it takes."</p>
            <p>On Earth, Kael had made significant progress. After days of digging, he finally reached the surface of the hidden layers. He wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the scene. "This... this can’t be right," he thought, staring at the vast structure before him. Despite his efforts, he couldn’t seem to reach the edges. The layers stretched out far beyond what he had imagined. It almost felt as if the structure was... infinite. His frustration was evident, but then, by sheer chance, Kael stumbled upon the entrance to the underground layer. He paused for a moment, staring into the dark abyss. "This is it," he whispered, taking a deep breath. "I’m going in." Without another word, he jumped in.</p>
            <p>Inside, Kael was stunned by the sheer scale of what he had uncovered. "This... this is impossible," he said aloud, walking through the expansive underground space. It felt as though he had left Earth entirely. Strange, cryptic inscriptions covered the walls, and alien artifacts lay scattered across the floor. Kael's curiosity grew with every step. "What happened here? What is all this?" he muttered, tracing his fingers over the inscriptions. His journey was only beginning, but he could already sense that something far greater was at play, something tied to Zorthian history, and to the man who had escaped into Earth's Depths: Dr. Vekroth.</p>

            <h3>Epilogue: A Collision of Worlds</h3>
            <p>The fates of Lirien and Kael were now set on a collision course. Their shared curiosity, once personal, had become a thread that bound them to the same mystery, spanning across two planets. The more they uncovered, the more they realized that their paths were not just parallel—they were destined to intersect. The legacy of Zorthian technology, the schemes of Dr. Vekroth, and the buried truths connecting Earth and Zorther were closing in on them. Together, they would have to face the dangers lurking beneath the surface.</p>
            <p>And as they ventured deeper into the unknown, they would come to understand that the secrets buried beneath their worlds were not just fragments of history—they were the keys to their futures. The question was: Would they be able to unlock them in time, or would the truth tear their worlds apart?</p>
            <p>Their worlds were only beginning to converge, with secrets buried deeper than they could fathom and dangers lurking just beyond their reach. What lay beneath the layers was more than history—it was the future of two civilizations.</p>
