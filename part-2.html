            <h3>Prologue: A Recap</h3>
            <p>In the last part, we saw that Lirien discovered Zephyride's sinister purpose, tied to an ancient conspiracy. Determined to uncover its origins, she prepared to defy the laws barring her from the depths. On Earth, Kael's discoveries inched him closer to truth, and the escaped scientist who lurked within Earth’s depths layer.</p>
            <p>The fates of Lirien and Kael were set on a collision course, their shared curiosity drawing them into a mystery spanning two planets. Their worlds were only beginning to converge, with secrets buried deeper than they could fathom and dangers lurking just beyond their reach. What lay beneath the layers was more than history—it was the future of two civilizations.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Chapter 1: Diving in the Depths</h3>
            <p>When Lirien was investigating the Zephyride, news of Dr. Vekroth Ilzhar's escape spread like wildfire across Zorther. The planet was in a frenzy—everyone was talking about him. Authorities issued warnings, urging citizens to stay vigilant, as it was feared that Vekroth could be anywhere within the planet’s layers. Rumors flourished, each more fantastical than the last. "Did he really escape?" "He must still be hiding deep in the Depths." "But the authorities haven’t found him..."</p>
            <p>Despite the growing panic, Lirien remained resolute. Her determination to uncover the truth about the Zephyride and its dark purpose had only intensified. She had a plan to find answers. She began visiting the homes of the volunteers who had participated in the Zephyride trials. Most were hesitant to speak, but one was a higher-ranking authority, someone who had been directly involved in the trials—Threx Talon.</p>
            <p>Threx was the first to notice when the Zephyride had begun malfunctioning, and he was the one who had alerted everyone before things escalated. His quick actions had saved lives, guiding the trial participants to safety and contacting higher authorities to ensure that the device was contained. But now, as Lirien explained her findings—the abandoned Zephyride she had discovered, and the alarming modifications she'd uncovered—Threx was taken aback by her resourcefulness. A young girl had unraveled a mystery that many adults had missed. He couldn’t help but wonder: How was the device not sent to the vaults in the Depths? Had someone simply forgotten?</p>
            <p>Seeing the urgency in Lirien’s investigation, Threx secured permission from the highest-ranking authorities to accompany her to the Depths, where the most dangerous and secretive matters were hidden. It was risky, but the truth needed to be uncovered. </p>
            <p>Before they could depart, Lirien’s brothers, Toris and Valtor, arrived. They insisted on coming along, determined to help their sister. Lirien hesitated. The Depths were no place for anyone who wasn’t prepared for its dangers. But her brothers, unwavering in their resolve, convinced her that they could be of assistance. Reluctantly, she agreed. The three of them, along with Threx, would journey into the Depths—into the heart of Zorther’s most closely guarded secrets.</p>
            <p>The elevator ride to the Depths was long, the journey silent. Each layer they descended took them further away from the familiar, the safe. The unknown loomed ahead, and with it, the answers they so desperately sought.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Echoes of the Past</h3>
            <p>As the elevator descended deeper into the heart of Zorther, the hum of its machinery filled the air, an ever-present reminder of the immense distance they were traveling. Lirien leaned against the wall, her thoughts drifting to memories of her father, Kenth Eryss. She remembered him vividly, speaking to her when she was younger about the remarkable feats of their ancestors. He had once described a starship that could journey through the vastness of space, and a device he called the Hypergate—a marvel of transportation capable of bridging unimaginable distances between fixed points in mere moments.</p>
            <p>"They used to explore other planets," Kenth had said, his eyes shining with reverence. "There was no limit to what Zorthians could accomplish."</p>
            <p>Lirien shared the memory with the others, breaking the silence of the long ride. The mention of these ancient devices sparked a conversation among the group. Threx, ever the knowledgeable authority, chimed in, eager to elaborate.</p>
            <p>"Centuries ago, Zorthians reached the pinnacle of exploration," he began. "They built fleets of starships designed for planetary discovery. Most of the planets they encountered were barren—lacking life, but rich with untapped resources and exotic elements. To make the most of these discoveries, they constructed layer systems similar to Zorther’s, enabling them to delve deep into the planets’ crusts for study. At the center of these operations was the Hypergate, a device capable of transporting objects across vast distances in the blink of an eye."</p>
            <p>Lirien and her brothers listened intently as Threx continued.</p>
            <p>"The Hypergate was revolutionary," he said, "but it was not without its flaws. While it could transport objects—sometimes even people—with incredible speed, there were rare but devastating failures. Some items simply disappeared, lost to the void of space. At first, the losses seemed negligible, limited to small, non-essential resources. But then came the tragedy. A group of travelers used the Hypergate and never reached their destination. Starships were sent to search for them, but they were never found."</p>
            <p>He paused, his tone growing somber.</p>
            <p>"That was when the Zorthians realized the cost of their ambition. Unable to predict or prevent these failures, they chose to abandon planetary exploration entirely. It was a painful decision, but they had gathered enough resources to thrive on Zorther, even managing to replicate the exotic elements they had discovered. Yet, the dream of interstellar discovery came to an end."</p>
            <p>The elevator vibrated slightly as it passed another threshold, the atmosphere growing heavier with every level they crossed.</p>
            <p>"One planet, however, was different," Threx added, his voice softening. "Earth. Unlike the lifeless worlds they had studied, Earth teemed with life. Humans lived there, a species full of potential. The Zorthians shared their technology with them, coexisting in harmony for a time. But when the decision to abandon planetary exploration was made, they couldn’t risk leaving their technology in the hands of humans, as they feared humans might not be capable of fully controlling their technology. They buried their inventions deep beneath the Earth’s surface and departed, leaving behind only whispers of their existence."</p>
            <p>Lirien’s mind raced with these revelations. She had heard fragments of these stories before, but never in such detail. Yet one memory stood out above the rest—a moment from her own past that she had almost forgotten.</p>
            <p>"When I was a child," she began hesitantly, "I accidentally swallowed a piece of Xerithium."</p>
            <p>Threx’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p>
            <p>"It’s supposed to be harmless," she continued, "and the doctors said I was fine. But I fainted—completely unconscious. They rushed me to the hospital, but I recovered so quickly it was as if nothing had happened. I’ve always wondered... could that be why I was able to partially control the Zephyride when no one else could?"</p>
            <p>The group fell silent, pondering her words. Toris, always quick to contribute, broke the tension.</p>
            <p>"Maybe," he said. "I mean, Vekroth’s lab was filled with strange experiments. I saw it once when I was younger. Father took me there on an errand. Vekroth was obsessed with chemistry. The place was like a maze of vials, strange gases, and glowing metals. Who knows what he was working on? Maybe Xerithium wasn’t as harmless as everyone believed."</p>
            <p>The mention of Vekroth brought an uneasy feeling to the group. The elevator shuddered slightly as it continued its descent, the weight of the planet pressing down on them. Temperature gradually raising. Ahead lay the Depths—and the secrets that had been buried for centuries.</p>
