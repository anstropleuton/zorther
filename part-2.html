            <h3>Prologue: A Recap</h3>
            <p>In the last part, we saw that Lirien discovered Zephyride's sinister purpose, tied to an ancient conspiracy. Determined to uncover its origins, she prepared to defy the laws barring her from the depths. On Earth, Kael's discoveries inched him closer to truth, and the escaped scientist who lurked within Earth’s depths layer.</p>
            <p>The fates of Lirien and Kael were set on a collision course, their shared curiosity drawing them into a mystery spanning two planets. Their worlds were only beginning to converge, with secrets buried deeper than they could fathom and dangers lurking just beyond their reach. What lay beneath the layers was more than history—it was the future of two civilizations.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Chapter 1: Diving in the Depths</h3>
            <p>When Lirien was investigating the Zephyride, news of Dr. Vekroth Ilzhar's escape spread like wildfire across Zorther. The planet was in a frenzy—everyone was talking about him. Authorities issued warnings, urging citizens to stay vigilant, as it was feared that Vekroth could be anywhere within the planet’s layers. Rumors flourished, each more fantastical than the last. "Did he really escape?" "He must still be hiding deep in the Depths." "But the authorities haven’t found him..."</p>
            <p>Despite the growing panic, Lirien remained resolute. Her determination to uncover the truth about the Zephyride and its dark purpose had only intensified. She had a plan to find answers. She began visiting the homes of the volunteers who had participated in the Zephyride trials. Most were hesitant to speak, but one was a higher-ranking authority, someone who had been directly involved in the trials—Threx Talon.</p>
            <p>Threx was the first to notice when the Zephyride had begun malfunctioning, and he was the one who had alerted everyone before things escalated. His quick actions had saved lives, guiding the trial participants to safety and contacting higher authorities to ensure that the device was contained. But now, as Lirien explained her findings—the abandoned Zephyride she had discovered, and the alarming modifications she'd uncovered—Threx was taken aback by her resourcefulness. A young girl had unraveled a mystery that many adults had missed. He couldn’t help but wonder: How was the device not sent to the vaults in the Depths? Had someone simply forgotten?</p>
            <p>Seeing the urgency in Lirien’s investigation, Threx secured permission from the highest-ranking authorities to accompany her to the Depths, where the most dangerous and secretive matters were hidden. It was risky, but the truth needed to be uncovered. </p>
            <p>Before they could depart, Lirien’s brothers, Toris and Valtor, arrived. They insisted on coming along, determined to help their sister. Lirien hesitated. The Depths were no place for anyone who wasn’t prepared for its dangers. But her brothers, unwavering in their resolve, convinced her that they could be of assistance. Reluctantly, she agreed. The three of them, along with Threx, would journey into the Depths—into the heart of Zorther’s most closely guarded secrets.</p>
            <p>The elevator ride to the Depths was long, the journey silent. Each layer they descended took them further away from the familiar, the safe. The unknown loomed ahead, and with it, the answers they so desperately sought.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Chapter 2: Echoes of the Past</h3>
            <p>As the elevator descended deeper into the heart of Zorther, the hum of its machinery filled the air, an ever-present reminder of the immense distance they were traveling. Lirien leaned against the wall, her thoughts drifting to memories of her father, Kenth Eryss. She remembered him vividly, speaking to her when she was younger about the remarkable feats of their ancestors. He had once described a starship that could journey through the vastness of space, and a device he called the Hypergate—a marvel of transportation capable of bridging unimaginable distances between fixed points in mere moments.</p>
            <p>"They used to explore other planets," Kenth had said, his eyes shining with reverence. "There was no limit to what Zorthians could accomplish."</p>
            <p>Lirien shared the memory with the others, breaking the silence of the long ride. The mention of these ancient devices sparked a conversation among the group. Threx, ever the knowledgeable authority, chimed in, eager to elaborate.</p>
            <p>"Centuries ago, Zorthians reached the pinnacle of exploration," he began. "They built fleets of starships designed for planetary discovery. Most of the planets they encountered were barren—lacking life, but rich with untapped resources and exotic elements. To make the most of these discoveries, they constructed layer systems similar to Zorther’s, enabling them to delve deep into the planets’ crusts for study. At the center of these operations was the Hypergate, a device capable of transporting objects across vast distances in the blink of an eye."</p>
            <p>Lirien and her brothers listened intently as Threx continued.</p>
            <p>"The Hypergate was revolutionary," he said, "but it was not without its flaws. While it could transport objects—sometimes even people—with incredible speed, there were rare but devastating failures. Some items simply disappeared, lost to the void of space. At first, the losses seemed negligible, limited to small, non-essential resources. But then came the tragedy. A group of travelers used the Hypergate and never reached their destination. Starships were sent to search for them, but they were never found."</p>
            <p>He paused, his tone growing somber.</p>
            <p>"That was when the Zorthians realized the cost of their ambition. Unable to predict or prevent these failures, they chose to abandon planetary exploration entirely. It was a painful decision, but they had gathered enough resources to thrive on Zorther, even managing to replicate the exotic elements they had discovered. Yet, the dream of interstellar discovery came to an end."</p>
            <p>The elevator vibrated slightly as it passed another threshold, the atmosphere growing heavier with every level they crossed.</p>
            <p>"One planet, however, was different," Threx added, his voice softening. "Earth. Unlike the lifeless worlds they had studied, Earth teemed with life. Humans lived there, a species full of potential. The Zorthians shared their technology with them, coexisting in harmony for a time. But when the decision to abandon planetary exploration was made, they couldn’t risk leaving their technology in the hands of humans, as they feared humans might not be capable of fully controlling their technology. They buried their inventions deep beneath the Earth’s surface and departed, leaving behind only whispers of their existence."</p>
            <p>Lirien’s mind raced with these revelations. She had heard fragments of these stories before, but never in such detail. Yet one memory stood out above the rest—a moment from her own past that she had almost forgotten.</p>
            <p>"When I was a child," she began hesitantly, "I accidentally swallowed a piece of Xerithium."</p>
            <p>Threx’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p>
            <p>"It’s supposed to be harmless," she continued, "and the doctors said I was fine. But I fainted—completely unconscious. They rushed me to the hospital, but I recovered so quickly it was as if nothing had happened. I’ve always wondered... could that be why I was able to partially control the Zephyride when no one else could?"</p>
            <p>The group fell silent, pondering her words. Toris, always quick to contribute, broke the tension.</p>
            <p>"Maybe," he said. "I mean, Vekroth’s lab was filled with strange experiments. I saw it once when I was younger. Father took me there on an errand. Vekroth was obsessed with chemistry. The place was like a maze of vials, strange gases, and glowing metals. Who knows what he was working on? Maybe Xerithium wasn’t as harmless as everyone believed."</p>
            <p>The mention of Vekroth brought an uneasy feeling to the group. They were just a few minutes away from reaching the Depths. The tension in the air was palpable, each person lost in their own thoughts about what lay ahead. The elevator shuddered slightly as it continued its descent. The hum of the elevator seemed to grow louder, reverberating through the walls as if the entire planet was aware of their descent. Temperature gradually raising. The further they traveled, the more the weight of secrecy and history pressed down on them.</p>
            <p>Just as the silence was becoming oppressive, Threx broke it his voice low and steady. "Do you remember the story about how all the dangerous technologies were destroyed for everyone's safety?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," they answered, their voices barely above a whisper.</p>
            <p>Threx’s voice dropped to a conspiratorial tone and his expression grew serious. "That was actually a myth created by our ancestors, meant to keep us from venturing into the Depths, from tampering with what they had left behind. They didn't destroy these inventions. They stored them—hidden in the vaults of the Depths. Every dangerous artifact, every piece of forgotten technology, is down there, waiting to be uncovered."</p>
            <p>A moment of stunned silence passed before Valtor, ever the skeptic, spoke up. "Could this be how Vekroth is hiding in there?" His words hung in the air like a dark cloud, unsettling everyone in the elevator. The thought was enough to send a shiver down their spines. The possibility made them all uneasy, as if the Depths were no longer just a place of mystery, but a trap they were walking into. The weight of the unknown pressing against their minds. It was no longer just a journey to uncover history. The Depths had become a dangerous game of cat and mouse.</p>
            <p>Everyone fell silent, the air thick with a sense of impending threat. They were nearing the heart of Zorther’s most closely guarded secrets, and whatever awaited them at the end of this journey would shape their fates in ways they could not yet comprehend. The tension in the elevator was unbearable, the fear of what lay ahead growing with every second that passed. They were about to reach the point where Zorther’s darkest secrets were buried, and no one could predict what dangers—or truths—lay ahead.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Chapter 3: Rallying of the Believers</h3>
            <p>On Earth, just as Vekroth's presence began to stir in the depths, Mara sat in her rocking chair, her mind suddenly gripped by a sense of foreboding. Her eyes snapped open, as if she could feel Vekroth’s arrival in the Depths—an unnatural disturbance that pulled her attention to Kael. She knew, deep in her bones, that he was walking into danger.</p>
            <p>Without hesitation, Mara reached out to the few elders still alive who had kept the old knowledge of the Zorthians. These were the ones who knew of the ancient beings' existence, though their numbers had dwindled over the years. Mara’s warning was urgent: something was stirring, something powerful. As she spoke, she found that her unease was not unique—others, too, had felt it, a shared sense of impending doom.</p>
            <p>Among them, only a handful had passed down the Zorthian lore to their children and grandchildren. But even fewer had truly believed the stories. The knowledge had been kept alive by the likes of Mara, who had given Kael a device capable of detecting buried objects beneath Earth's surface—a tool he used to uncover the hidden Zorthian layered system.</p>
            <p>The time had come to act. Mara had gathered a small group—three elder experts, including herself, each a keeper of the forgotten Zorthian knowledge, and a few of their children who had long believed in the old stories. Together, they formed a quiet, determined team, bound by the shared truth of the Zorthians' past. The elders were Thelgar Malcor, a stoic and wise man, who had spent years researching ancient technologies, and Solena Juno, a sharp-minded woman, who had always felt a strange connection to the Zorthian artifacts that once crossed Earth's surface.</p>
            <p>Their children, too, had inherited a spark of the old knowledge. There was Nira, Thelgar’s daughter, a resourceful woman in her thirties with a scientific mind and an unshakable belief in the strange histories her father spoke of. Alongside her was Darin, Solena’s son, an adventurous man, eager to uncover the truth and uncover his family’s legacy. Together, this small but passionate team would make their way to the Earth's forgotten layers, with a goal to find Kael and uncover the mysteries.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 4: Whispers in the Depths</h3>
            <p>The moment Vekroth materialized in Earth’s Depths layer, he was overcome by disorientation. The Hypergate had deposited him in what appeared to be an endless void. Darkness enveloped everything, its oppressive weight a stark reminder of how far from the surface—and from light—he had ventured. The air was stale and heavy, the temperature as stifling as he had expected. It was unmistakable: he was in the Depths.</p>
            <p>Reaching for the bright flash lantern he had engineered, he activated it with a swift tap on its side. The sudden beam sliced through the darkness, revealing desolation. Prison cells, long empty and corroded by time, lined the walls like haunting relics of a forgotten era. Their emptiness felt almost mocking, but Vekroth dismissed the thought with a sneer. He had no time for such distractions. He needed power to recharge his Hypergate—a vital step if he were to establish his presence here and prepare for what lay ahead.</p>
            <p>As he ventured deeper, his frustration grew. Vault after vault yielded nothing of use. The barren storerooms held neither Everult, the vital energy batteries he needed, nor functional generators. His initial confidence began to wane. Could this entire Depths layer truly be so devoid of resources?</p>
            <p>But Vekroth was nothing if not resourceful. Even in the face of scarcity, his brilliant mind churned. He turned to chemistry—the one science he knew could offer him a solution, even in such dire circumstances. If he could not find power, he would create it.</p>
            <p>Determined, Vekroth scavenged every piece of technology he could find, dismantling devices and prying open their components. From the remnants, he managed to recover several depleted Everults. Though their energy was spent, the chemicals within remained intact. His lantern, too, became a tool in his experiments. With careful precision, he diverted its remaining energy to power his rudimentary setup.</p>
            <p>When he finally cracked open the first Everult, the resulting explosion echoed through the Depths like a thunderclap. The shockwave reverberated through the abandoned structure, stirring the silence into a cacophony of vibrations. The air around him trembled, and far above, Kael froze.</p>
            <p>Kael had been cautiously exploring the first underground layer of the buried system, guided by the detection device Mara had given him. He had descended with hope, but the oppressive darkness soon weighed on him, sapping his courage. His flashlight could only pierce so far into the black abyss, and every step he took seemed to invite unseen eyes to watch him.</p>
            <p>When the bang reached his ears, it shattered the uneasy silence. The sound rumbled through the ground like a warning, and Kael felt his skin crawl. A cold sweat broke across his forehead as his sense of unease morphed into something far worse. It was as if the darkness had come alive, pressing in on him, whispering threats he couldn’t understand.</p>
            <p>He turned to retreat, his resolve crumbling under the weight of his fear. But as he neared the entrance to the surface, his instincts screamed at him to stop. Something was there. Shapes moved above, silhouetted against the faint glow of the entryway. Shadows loomed, silent and menacing, waiting for him.</p>
            <p>Kael’s breath hitched as he tried to climb the dirt slope leading out. His foot slipped on a loose rock, sending it tumbling down the incline. The clatter rang out like a beacon in the quiet, and Kael’s heart raced. He looked up, the shadowy figure above turned toward him, as if staring at him. It was over for him.</p>
            <p>Panic overtook him, his limbs locking in terror. He stumbled back, hitting the ground hard, his flashlight slipping from his grasp. The beam flickered and died, plunging him into darkness. Paralyzed with fear, he lay there, unable to move, convinced that whatever was above would come for him.</p>
            <p>Then, a familiar voice broke the spell.</p>
            <p>"Kael!"</p>
            <p>His eyes snapped open, his breath catching. The voice was unmistakable.</p>
            <p>"Mara?" he whispered, his voice trembling with relief.</p>
            <p>The shadowy figure stepped forward, resolving into the elderly woman who had sent him on this journey. Behind her stood her team. They helped Kael to his feet, offering him water and words of comfort. Mara’s calm presence eased his panic, and slowly, his breathing steadied.</p>
            <p>"They’re here," Kael said at last, his voice raw. "I heard something. A bang. It was... close."</p>
            <p>Mara exchanged a glance with the team. The noise Kael had described was no ordinary sound. It could only mean one thing: someone—or something—had entered the Depths.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Vekroth continued his work. The first Everult had yielded promising results, and he wasted no time breaking apart the second. Another bang tore through the silence, louder and more forceful than the last. This time, it carried a faint but ominous tremor that rippled through the walls and floors.</p>
            <p>Even far above, Mara and her team felt it, their expressions darkening as the vibrations reached them.</p>
            <p>"We’re not alone," Solena muttered.</p>
            <p>Vekroth, oblivious to their presence, was consumed by his task. He had finally gathered enough materials to conduct a meaningful experiment. Carefully, he extracted the chemical components from the Everults, isolating Vazron (Qa) and the inert gas Valxuor (L₄Sq₂Ar₃H₂). With deliberate precision, he combined them, watching as the reaction began to unfold.</p>
            <p>A faint hum filled the air as energy started to build. The process was crude and unstable, but it was working. Silquor (Sq), the glowing byproduct, pooled around his makeshift apparatus, casting an eerie light in the darkness.</p>
            <p>For the first time since his arrival, Vekroth allowed himself a grim smile. He had power. It was only a matter of time before he could reestablish his Hypergate—and his plans could truly begin.</p>
